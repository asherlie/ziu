a peer to peer network - similar to egg
that is a message board

a protocol for storing messages between many computers
without the possibility of deletion

[msg, msg1, msg2, msg3]

[msg, hash(msg)+msg2]

to participate in a messageboard
each user must store all messages locally
unencrypted
each board will have a size limit
200 char limit, 10 char uname

when a message is sent, the running hash of
all messages earlier than new msg is sent 

how do we avoid malicious nodes?

we could assume the majority of nodes are correct
and ban any dissenters

join p2p mboard by connecting to existing member IP, download msg history if it exists
send message by hashing all prev msgs and sending raw bytes of new msg
spread this message to all nodes
    if a node agrees - send a MSG_AFFIRM_HASH:target=phash_msghash=hash(new msg)

    hmm could we ignore all this agree/disagree shit and just have each node separately
    accept and believe messages that match and add them to their running hashes

    nodes that don't follow the convention will never get their messages propogated

    if a node somehow gets corrupted, it can always just redownload msg history

rhash = hash((hash(hash(msg)+msg1)+msg2)+msg3)
